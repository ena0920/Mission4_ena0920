<p>
    IS 413, or Enterprise Application Development, was very daunting to me. I've historically not been a very strong developer,
    so I was a bit scared to learn yet another language. However, I wanted this semester to be different. I wanted to shift my mindset
    to be more receptive of growth instead of accepting myself for the poor developer that I am currently. Maybe this is different than
    what you were expecting in terms of what I hope to get out of this class, but I want to be able to change how I think about my
    abilities, and I believe that this class will provide me the avenue to do just that.
